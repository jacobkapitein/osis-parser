# TS OSIS Parser

This is a parser for OSIS documents, written in TypeScript. Please note that this is a work in progress, and is not yet ready for production use.
The project is very unstable and I'm contantly changing the API.

I will add tests later on, but for now I'm just trying to get the parser to work efficiently. I also want the code to be as SOLID as possible, because the OSIS format is a huge format and I'm only just getting started.
Making the project as SOLID as possible will make it easier to add new features later on which are in the OSIS specification.

The OSIS specification is **old** (latest version 2.1.1 from 2006), but still reliable. It's a very good format for storing Bible data, and it's used by many Bible software applications.
The specification document used for this project can be found [here](http://crosswire.org/osis/OSIS%202.1.1%20User%20Manual%2006March2006.pdf).
